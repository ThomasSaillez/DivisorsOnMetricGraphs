# DivisorsOnMetricGraphs
This is a MATLAB toolbox to implement metric graphs and divisors on metric graphs. 
More precisely, this toolbox contains classes to work with metric graphs, divisors, double coverings of metric graphs and antisymmetric divisors on a double covering. 
Dhar's algorithm and the computation of the euclidean distance of a divisor are implemented.

For the mathematical background, one can refer itself to [these notes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14060).

To learn hot to use this package, you can open the GettingStarted.mlx file.

If you have any bug report, remark or suggestions, you can e-mail me at thomas DOT saillez AT ulb DOT be.

I would like to thank Yoav Len for introducing me to the subject of divisors on metric graphs. I would like to thank Špela Špenko for her advices and boosts of motivation.
I would also like to thank Brieuc Saillez for his help towards programming. Lastly, a huge thanks goes to Robin Petit for the multiple times he helped me.
